Display a custom list of books from any of your Goodreads.com bookshelves, and stylize it however you want using your own HTML and CSS.

== Description ==

WordPress Goodreads Bookshelf (aka Bookshelf) allows you to display a custom list of books from your [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com) shelves anywhere on your site that PHP is allowed.

*   You can choose from any one of your bookshelves including your custom shelves on [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com).
*   You can specify how many books it should retrieve from the shelf and how often it should update the list on your site.
*   You have full control of how the list is displayed using your own HTML and CSS.  So you can easily make it blend in with the rest of your blog.
*   If you have a private account on [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com) there are specific instructions to set up Bookshelf so that it retrieves your books, but your profile can still remain private.
*   You can use all the standard information (title, author, cover image, isbn) as well as some more detailed information such as rating, date read, review, and many more.
